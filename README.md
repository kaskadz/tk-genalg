# Genalg
_Generic, island based genetic simulation framework._

## TODO
- [x] Solve loosing migrants at the end of simulation
- [x] Add some kind of logging (tracking simulation state)
- [x] Ensure migrations are actually working
- [x] Update gene generation to use random double instead of int
- [x] Make migrator receive evaluated population (in order for it to make decisions based on entity's fitness)
- [x] Find the shortest delay interval
- [ ] Add 'allstop' condition
- [ ] Refactor handling the results
- [ ] Add noise to simulation model implementation
- [ ] Introduce an interface for each component
